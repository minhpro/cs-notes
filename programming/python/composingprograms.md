# Preface

All computing begins with representing information, specifying logic to process it, and designing abstractions that manage the complexity of that logic. Mastering these fundamentals will require us to understand precisely how computers interpret computer programs and carry out **computational processes**.

We need a programming language to define computional processes, preferably one that humans and computers can all understand.
