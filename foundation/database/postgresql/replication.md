## Database replication

In the context of database, `replication` means creating a copy of a database.

In PostgreSQL, there are 2 types of replication: 

* Streaming replication (physical replication) that replicates a database cluster.
* And logical replication that replicates in units of tables and databases.

## Streaming replication

Allows the updated information on the primary server to be transferred to the standby server in real time. We can get great benefits to our system:

* **Failover**: When the primary server fails, the standby server can take over the operation.
* **Read-only load balancing**: Read-only SQL processing can be distributed among multiple servers.

By using the load balancing feature Ã² pgpool-ii, an open source extension, read-only queries can be efficiently distributed between the PostgreSQL instances, and workload can be balanced.

## Streaming replication mechanism

PostgreSQL saves the updated information of the primary server as a transaction log known as `write-ahead log` or `WAL`, in preparation for crash recovery or rollback. Streaming replication works by transferring the WAL to the standy server in real time, and applying it on the standy server.
